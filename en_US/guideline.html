    <h1>ガイドライン</h1>
    <p>1. Sprites or BGM from Hell of World (hereafter referred to as HOW) may be used by anyone involved in production without any claims being made (those creating sprites, etc., must agree to this).
2. If you wish to use a sprite or BGM from HOW, you must obtain permission from the administrator, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Siratama1538">Siratama1538</a>.
        2. If you wish to use HOW sprites or BGM, ask the administrator, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Siratama1538">Siratama1538</a>.
        <br>
        3. Copyright belongs to <a href="/Hell-of-World-official-site/ja/#creats">those involved in HOW's production</a>.
        <br>
        4. Unauthorized use by others is generally prohibited (though thumbnails for videos, etc., are permitted).
        <br>
        5. Video recording and promotional use are permitted.
        <br>
        6. Fan art (FA) may be freely created without permission. (※However, sprite modifications must be created only after obtaining permission from the original creator,
        and avoid making careless alterations whenever possible.)<br>
        <br>
        7. For works created as homages to HOW, please consider crediting the original work, Hell of World, in your credits.<br>(
        As this work also contains elements homaged from <a href="/Hell-of-World-official-site/ja/#homage">Chaos End, etc.</a>,
        it is preferable to also credit Chaos End and its creator in your credits.)<br>
        <br>
        8. When creating HOW animations (UTSA) on YouTube or Scratch, obtain permission from the administrator, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Siratama1538">Siratama1538</a>.
        (If you wish to use sprites or music, obtain permission from the creator.) Also, ensure proper credit attribution.<br>
        <br>
        9. FA content must be R18-rated; extremely gory material is prohibited (minor blood depictions like blood on clothing are acceptable; 18+ content is permitted as long as it doesn't involve horns (within Scratch Team guidelines)).<br>
        <br>
        10. Works created as homages to HOW that include content violating public order and morals, political statements, discriminatory remarks, hate speech, or commercial purposes are prohibited.<br>
        <br>
                11. Collaborations with trios or other AU are prohibited except in the following cases:<br>
        ・Permission has been obtained from the owner of the collaborating AU<br>
        ・You are the owner of the collaborating AU<br>
        ・The owner of the collaborating AU has publicly stated that participation in trio-related AUs is permitted<br>
        ・Works featuring only HOW characters, etc.<br>
        If the guidelines of the collaboration partner or other AU contain content that violates HOW's guidelines,<br>
        it is acceptable if resolved through discussion with the collaboration partner's administrator, etc., but if it is deemed unacceptable due to the violation, you must stop. <br>
        Furthermore, we also reserve the right to freely refuse such collaborations.<br>
        <br>
        12. When creating MOD-like content (HOW Hard Mode versions) or full-length works (like the original Obawa or Under Yellow),<br>
        you must obtain permission from “everyone” involved with HOW before production.<br>
        <br>
        13. If the game contains any shocking elements (light effects, blood, depressing content, etc.) – though this is undecided as development is still early –<br>
         should you experience adverse effects like physical or mental distress, <a href="/Hell-of-World-official-site/ja/#creats">this team</a> bears no responsibility whatsoever.<br>
        (We will clearly state in the description that the game contains shocking elements.) Therefore, we will not accept any complaints.
        <br>
        14. In videos, such as gameplay or clear videos, please refrain from arbitrarily adding original effects as much as possible.
        However, animations for song covers or original effects like UTSA are acceptable.
        Additionally, <a href="/Hell-of-World-official-site/ja/#creats">those involved in HOW production</a> may freely add original effects to their videos.<br>
        (Example: The composer creating HOW game animations in the background while their song plays)<br>
        <br>
        15. If you encounter bugs, glitches, typos, or errors, actively cooperate by reporting them to the administrator, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Siratama1538">Siratama1538</a>.
        (Or rather, actively encourage others to do so.)
        The <a href="/Hell-of-World-official-site/ja/#creats">production team</a> will handle such matters to the best of their ability. If there are bugs that cannot be fixed, please view them with understanding.<br>
        <br>
        16. Feel free to share videos and streams, but refrain from making critical remarks about the game or its creators. If possible, include a link to the game in the description.
        <br>
        17. Avoid creating fan art based on tracing or copying existing works. While publicly sharing traced artwork is prohibited, using traced images for practice purposes is permitted.
        Do not publish traced works online. Also, do not claim them as your own creations.
        <br>
        18. Music, sounds, sprites, etc., that are explicitly permitted for free use by their creators
        may be used without permission in Scratch or YouTube, provided you give credit and absolutely refrain from claiming them as your own creations.
